## 1. Overview / Problem Statement

- While the Personalized Feed provides relevant courses for the current semester, students may need to search for courses and content outside their current academic timeline.
- This feature allows users to find courses and materials that are not included in their personalized feed, such as those from previous semesters or upcoming courses.

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals

- Enable keyword search for courses and content across all departments.
- Allow filtering of search results by department.
- Facilitate the discovery of courses and materials not found in the Personalized Feed.

### Non-Goals

- Does not provide personalized recommendations based on user behavior.
- Does not include filtering by semester or year.

## 3. User Stories

- **As a student**, I want to search for courses and content that aren't in my personalized feed, so I can find materials from previous semesters or those not automatically included.

- **As an admin**, I want my users to easily find any course or content they need, even if it's not part of their personalized feed, such as courses from past years or future offerings.

## 4. Architecture

- **Frontend**: The frontend will provide a search bar where users can enter keywords and filter by department.

- **Backend**: The backend will handle search queries and return relevant courses and content based on the keyword and department filter.

- **Database**: The database will be indexed for efficient keyword searches and filtering by department.
