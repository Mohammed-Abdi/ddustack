## 1. Overview / Problem Statement

- While the Personalized Feed and Search functionalities cover most user needs, there are situations where users may not know the exact name of a course or content.
- The categorization feature allows users to browse through a structured hierarchy—starting with the school, then the department, followed by the academic year and semester—making it easier to find relevant materials.

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals

- Provide a hierarchical browsing experience for users who do not know the exact course or content name.
- Allow users to navigate through the school, department, year, and semester to find relevant content.
- Enhance the overall user experience by offering an additional, intuitive way to browse.

### Non-Goals

- Does not replace the personalized feed or search functionalities.
- Does not provide keyword search; purely for browsing through categories.

## 3. User Stories

- **As a student**, I want to browse through categories like school, department, year, and semester so that I can find the courses and content I need, even if I don't know the exact name.

- **As an admin**, I want students to have an easy and intuitive way to find content through categorization, ensuring that no material is hard to find.

## 4. Architecture

- **Frontend**: The frontend will provide a hierarchical navigation interface that lets users select their school, then department, and then filter by year and semester.

- **Backend**: The backend will organize content into these hierarchical categories and provide endpoints that return relevant materials based on the selected categories.

- **Database**: The database will store the hierarchical relationships between schools, departments, years, and semesters.

## 5. Testing & Metrics

### Testing

- Unit tests for the categorization logic and data retrieval.
- Integration tests to ensure that the hierarchy is correctly implemented and that content is retrieved accurately.
- UI tests for the navigation and browsing experience.

### Metrics / KPIs
